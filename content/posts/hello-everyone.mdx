Hello everyone, my name is Aleksandar Vasilevski and I am a Software Developer and AWS Solutions Architect (soon hopefully certified). 
Most of the time I work with JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS but sometimes I want to put my hands on new technologies. 
I have decided to open this website so I can write my journey through the Software Development and share my experiences.
Previousley I was writing on another blog but it was mostley tutorials, here I want to focus on sharing real world experiences.
I will try for begining to write atleast one new post every week, but depend on my schedule and real life stuff this may change from time to time.

Thank you for visiting and lets learn something new
